brg180 crashes on assignment problem, i even printed out the matrixx
it was doing and the ap works fine.  the assignor and the assmnt are -1
in two locations so they should/could have pointed to each other.

find best secord, using min_span algorithm.

--

Prove a single edge not in optimal solution untill you have a small set of
edges, to permutate.

--

doing full secord, doesn't work but should.

trying single branching but sacred_secord isn't working see -s55 ar

--

may be a way to permutate edges in a manner to get a 1rst/2nd edge aray to
conform to a tour.

--

solve small optimal subtours and patch to make a larger optimal.

--

make semi neural net to determine which edges are easily improveable and
then optimally solve those edges keeping the remaining edges of a base tour
sane, if optimal solver can not improve any more then stop.

--

parallel suspend, make sure you can suspend a parallel process and no one
will try to send signals to it AND the primary client will still exist as
long as there are suspended processes running.

--

parallel problem: if a non-primary client finds a better tour, the primary
client could be in an idle state, and then it would see there are no more
clients left with out getting the better tour from the non-primary client...
the only way to do this will probably when i later put in the runner module
that will be able to save itself and therfore be updated by file.

I'll Try to at the end of the primary client load in the tour file to the last
TourFinder Run.

--

probelm with processes losing ability to receive signals, maybe i can
continuously set the catch signal function... or maybe the newer sigactioin
will work.

make kswapping better for onetree's
