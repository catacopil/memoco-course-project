(2) Making a restorable runner class that triggers algorithms and
remembers which were run and doesn't doubley run an algorithm if it
needs to be run again on the same map.  i.e. if you enter ad+tr+k14 ad+tr+k3
the (ad+tr) tour and time will be saved so it doesn't have to be run twice.

(2) I've got the runner class, but i need to figure a way to store and keep
	track of tours already found, i think i can init the data structure by the
   inited tour finders, so i know which ones will need to be run more than
   once.  then once i have those, i make a data structure that will mark and
   have pointers to the tours already run, and some how edit the tour finder
   names (maybe replace the plus sign with a to mark where i need to start
   using the "different" tour improvement procedures on the tour already
   found.
