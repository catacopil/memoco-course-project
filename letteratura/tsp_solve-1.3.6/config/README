This directory contains files that create the configure script from the file
configure.in in the parent directory.  The defines set in configure.in should
be self explainatory.  The Makefile is a makefile since cleaning removes
Makefiles.

There are also config.h files for platforms that may not be able to run the
configure script made here.  (i.e. borland.h)
