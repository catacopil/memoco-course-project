Version 1.3.6

Tue Nov 14 09:54:40 PST 1995

-- added two new random tour finders that use random ropted tours

Version 1.3.5

Mon Jun 12 09:52:44 PDT 1995

-- added usr1sig to parallel processes so they will save they're current info
   into a new file which is mapped by the hosts file.
-- finished savings algorithm, not very impressive
-- sped up hungarian algorithm

Tue May 23 15:06:53 PDT 1995

-- started on savings heuristic

-- rewrote the save and restore structure for the optimal algorithms, this
   also enabled more use of hiearchical functions that worked for all optimal
   solvers.

Mon May 15 14:40:17 PDT 1995

-- made k10 swaping mechanism to work with hungaria, doesn't seem to work as
   good as others.

April 1995

-- added hungaria back in because hungaria now doesn't crash on the 8 city tsp
   will not keep in public version if i don't get a disclaimer from Bob.
-- completed arborescnece algorithm, with help of additional paper, also made
   a faster 1-tree with a N^2 algrorithm rather than the N^2logN algorithm.
   if SYMMETRY is defined in oneaborq.cc them symmetric 1-tree algorithm is used
   otherwise the arborescence is used for tour finder "arbor"

Version 1.3.5

Feb 1995

-- added 1-arborescence algorithm for asymmetric tsps which have a matrix where
   Cij is approximatley close to Cji.  The O(N^2) dense arborescence algorithm
   was derived from my own interpretation of the dense minimum spaning tree
   algorithm from Segwick C++ Algorithms.  I found a reference to Optimum
   branchings by Tarjan, but i found it imobile and uncomprehendable to
   take seriously. (ceh)
-- removed hungaria* ant* flexmap* since the algorithms were by other authors
   and weren't contending with ceh's algorithms, with the exception of
   hungaria* which performs slightly better for N<13 to optimall solve tsps,
   than standard*. (ceh)

Tue Jan 03 12:13:28 PST 1995

-- still debuging some parallel miscongruities, rshing doesn't work well (ceh)
-- finished a new assignment problem algorithm that branches differently from
   the old, and performs much better (ceh)
-- also added parallel read/write functions to the new AP algorithm (ceh)

Mon Nov 21 10:49:17 PST 1994

-- finished most of the debugging of the parallel module (ceh)
-- added christofides heuristic (ceh)
-- removed threeopt.cc since the R-Opt combined with the old treeopt works
   faster and better.  now treeopt becomes threeopt (ceh)

Version 1.3.4

-- fixed multifrag heuristic so it would work better (ceh)
-- implimented Lin and Kernighan R-Opt (1973) from The TSP book (ceh)
-- enhanced the nearest addition procedure, added angle functionality
   and made convex hull initial tour for farthest insertion (ceh)
-- added my own farthest insertion procedure to replace rjc's (ceh)
-- started to design parrallel processing

Sat Sep 10 22:11:06 PDT 1994

-- added variant kswaping for symmetric TSPs (slower than hoped, ceh)
-- added 3-opt procedure, for use with "treeopt", much faster but
   not as completley exhaustive as "threeopt" (ceh)
-- made Assignment optimal solver work for floating point costs. (ceh)
-- added Ant Heuristic (ceh)
-- added multifrag heuristic (ceh)

Mon Jul 04 17:18:05 PDT 1994

-- made kswaping procedure for asymmetric tsps
-- AP B&B algorithm accomplished as (assign) tourfinder
-- made fouropt heuristic for asymetric tsps
-- moved twoopt.cc to nopt.cc
-- made tsp_solve.tex
-- fixed some HP Makefile bugs (dkraay@mgmt.purdue.edu)

Version 1.3.3

Sun Jun 05 10:31:57 PDT 1994

-- made Asymmetric 3-Opt procedure "treeopt"
-- making midget tsp_solve executable linkable for a few tour finders
-- added oneway input options for oneway TSPs
-- added -fFilename input option to replace stdin
-- finished autoconf configure script

Version 1.3.2b

Mon May 23 13:40:51 PDT 1994

-- made tour improvements specifiable in command line interface
-- made regular one-tree train before branching to improve it slightly
-- fixed a few bugs sent in by dsj@reserach.att.com

Version 1.2.99b

Wed May 04 18:21:22 PDT 1994

-- separated binfile.cc and io.cc class from term.cc
-- added clock() Timer class functionality if platforms don't have ftime()

Version 1.2.9b

Sat Apr 30 16:04:53 PDT 1994

-- added Dispersion heuristic (does very well for Asym.TSPs) (Chad Hurwitz)
-- made config file for DEC (Michael J. Hennebry)

Wed Apr 27 23:09:42 PDT 1994

- added FLEXMAP implimentation (algorithm Bernd Fritzke and Peter Wilke)
- added circlist object which is a circular list of same base class objects

Tue Apr 26 19:23:04 PDT 1994

- config/linux.h created (Jeff Riegel) riegel@almaden.ibm.com

Tue Apr 26 14:40:13 PDT 1994

- added -d option to overide distance function

Thu Apr 21 13:48:12 PDT 1994

- fixed geographic distance function (G.Reinelt)
- solved more tsplib instances in TSPS_SOLVED
- added more tsplib features (UPPER_ROW and LOWER_DIAG_ROW input formats)
- added ability to use exponetials and negatives in input files

Tue Apr 19 09:43:23 PDT 1994

- took out the global name externs from each tourfinder, since some c++
  compilers won't use globals in static arrays. (R.J.Craig)

Version 1.2b

Sun Apr 17 10:47:15 PDT 1994

- added TSPLIB input and output options -- and -p4
- started the TSPS_SOLVED file
- more porting bugs fixed

Thu Apr 14 15:49:03 PDT 1994

- added config directory for separate platforms
- added new makefile dependencies to accomodate make "platform" name

Wed Apr 13 22:22:03 PDT 1994

- added hungarian algorithm by R.J. Craig

Tue Apr 12 20:19:21 PDT 1994

- fixed standard solver so it will solve Asymmetric TSPs

Tue Apr 12 09:57:09 PDT 1994 ceh

- changed Hueristic to Heuristic
- added EasyTour heuristic
- added -m-2 option to enter a TSP in specified order for the EasyTour

Version 1.1b
