Gnu Autoconf has made it possible to make installing a breeze, for the most
part you should be able to just enter two commands to completely make this
software "./configure ; make CFLAGS=-O2" it should find the right compilers
and right options to set if you have all the necessary utilities on your
system.  If you do not have Gnu make, you may have to append the Makefile.ngn
to the ./configure created Makefile, so the .cc dependencies can be realized.

If you are really lazy, there is a shell script that will do two commands for
you called "mak".  If you want to debug tsp_solve, use "./configure ; make".
Depending on what platform you run, you might see lots of Warnings with a
-Wall option.  We've tried to gut all the warnings.  However, if you find
some with a different compiler than gcc, let us know where they are.

If you are very concerend about the data types of the TSP or you need to answer
specifically following questions:  What is the largest city ID I need to use?
i.e. Do I need a two byte or one byte city ID type?  Do I need to use floating
point vs. integer aritmetic for tour lengths?  edge costs?  Then, read the
first part of stdmacro.h and change the #defines there before compiling.

Borland C++ users must "copy config/borland.h config.h" since the configure
script probably won't work in msdos.  Also when using a version of Borland
less than 4.0, #define NO_ARRAY_CONSTRUCTING in your config.h file, since the
lesser versions of borland do not support automatic constructing of objects
`new'ed in arrays.

So far tsp_solve has been compiled on DEC, Sun, HP, AIX RSx000, and SCO UNIXes
with gcc as well as a Borland 3.1, 4.0 compilers for ibm pc's.

If you get another platform to work, please send churritz@cts.com the config.h,
Makefile.in, configure.in or other source changes that were needed.
