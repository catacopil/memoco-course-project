# memoco-course-project

Solving and measuring the performance of a TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem).
During this project I used the exact CPLEX solver and some Solvers that use Heuristics (Local Search, Tabu Search).
If you need some clarifications about how the project works and how the Heuristics are implemented.

Attention: this project use the CPLEX solver, that is property of IBM. If you want to use CPLEX for your academic projects you can ask IBM for the academic version (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/CPLEX_Is_Free_For_Students?lang=en)
